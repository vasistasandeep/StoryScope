# Railway Deployment - Fixed Approach

## The Issue
Railway doesn't support Docker-in-Docker, so we can't use `docker-compose` inside Railway containers.

## Solution: Deploy API Service Only + External Databases

### Step 1: Deploy API Service
```bash
# Your API service is already deployed, but let's fix it
railway up
```

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL Database
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.com/project/c2fb0e0a-80ad-4d8e-9d8d-53019605ab56
2. Click "New +" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Step 3: Add Redis Cache
1. Click "New +" → "Database" → "Redis"
2. Railway will automatically set `REDIS_URL` environment variable

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Set NLP service URL (we'll use a mock for now)
railway variables set NLP_URL=http://localhost:8001
railway variables set PORT=8000
```

### Step 5: Deploy NLP Service Separately
We need to deploy the NLP service as a separate Railway service:

1. Create a new Railway project for NLP
2. Or use a simpler approach with a mock NLP service

## Alternative: Use Railway's Multi-Service Support

Railway now supports multiple services in one project. Let's try this approach:

1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Add a new service for the NLP component
3. Configure each service separately

## Quick Fix: Mock NLP Service

For immediate deployment, let's create a simple mock NLP service:
